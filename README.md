# jvmlang

**jvmlang** is an experimental project aimed at creating a new programming language with a Java-like syntax that compiles to Java bytecode. This project explores the fundamental concepts of language design, parsing, and compilation while allowing developers to experiment with novel features and syntactic constructs.

## Goals

The primary goals of the jvmlang project include:

1. **Understanding Language Design**: Investigating the principles of creating a programming language and its associated tooling.
2. **Exploring Compiler Construction**: Gaining practical experience in writing compilers and interpreters.
3. **Experimenting with New Concepts**: Testing innovative programming paradigms and language features that are not present in mainstream languages.
